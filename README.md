# **Tailor-Made LLMs: Using Your Data to Personalise LLMs with RAG**

## **Introduction:**

The advancement of generative AI has given rise to AI chatbots, which have taken the world by storm. The conversations these chatbots generate are almost indistinguishable from those between two humans. The key to this capability lies in Large Language Models (LLMs).

Many of us, if not all, have utilised chatbots like ChatGPT, BERT, etc., to assist us in various tasks. These bots are incredibly helpful when they accurately address the prompts. However, this isn't always the case.

At times, these bots confidently provide us with incorrect, outdated, or inaccurate responses. This phenomenon, known as hallucination, involves the chatbots confidently generating responses that are sometimes entirely fabricated.

Just take a moment to imagine a scenario in a critical environment, such as within organisations, where misinformation has the potential to jeopardise the entire operation. The consequences could be significant, don't you think?

The limitations posed by existing LLMs have led to the emergence of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## **1. What is RAG?**

*Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* is a technique that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by supplementing them with the context and specificity derived from personal or domain-specific data.

In essence, RAG integrates user-provided data sources as reference points during response generation, enabling LLMs to produce outputs that are provably more accurate, reliable, and aligned with the intended prompt or query.

Imagine RAG as a meticulous fact-checker for your LLM. Just like a well-informed editor reviews and verifies information before publication, RAG consults your pre-selected data sources to ensure the LLM's responses align with factual accuracy and domain-specific knowledge. This safeguards against misleading or inaccurate information, especially in critical environments where reliability is paramount.

## **2. Why Use RAG?**

Technically, general-knowledge Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on the data they were trained on. Consequently, they may contain outdated information or lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucination.

Certain domains, such as legal, healthcare, and government, use specialised jargon—often a realm of terms that might seem like "mumbo jumbo" to outsiders. These terms may not carry the same meaning in other contexts.

Mastering such domains requires learning a new language, a challenge shared by LLMs. To ensure our LLMs align with specific applications and contexts, it's crucial to enable them to interact effectively within particular domains.

Keep in mind that we aim to equip our powerful LLMs with the ability to comprehend specialised language by thoroughly examining domain documents before responding to the queries.

While one option is to retrain the LLM with data from a specific domain, this approach is not only expensive but also resource-intensive.

Rather than taking the costly route of retraining, we can leverage the *RAG system* to assist LLMs in responding to questions related to documents in specific domains.

## **3. Who Uses RAG?**

The arrival of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) marks a transformative shift in how humans interact with data. No longer confined to static repositories, information comes alive, engaging in a dynamic dialogue with users. This revolutionary approach unlocks a myriad of potential applications, far exceeding the limitations of available datasets.

Imagine a world where healthcare professionals converse with a generative AI enriched by comprehensive medical databases, instantly gleaning insights to guide their critical decisions.Financial analysts dance with dynamic market data through their digital assistants, gaining an edge in the ever-evolving financial landscape.

This transformative power extends beyond specialised fields. Businesses large and small can breathe life into their own internal resources, from technical manuals to video archives, transforming them into potent knowledge bases that empower LLMs. With these newfound companions, customer support teams can handle inquiries with unparalleled precision, field technicians gain instant access to critical expertise, and employee training soars to new heights, unlocking unparalleled productivity.

The vast potential of RAG has ignited a fire within leading tech giants like [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/simplify-access-to-internal-information-using-retrieval-augmented-generation-and-langchain-agents/), [IBM](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG), Google, Microsoft, [NVIDIA](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-retrieval-augmented-generation/), [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag/), and [Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/retrieval-augmented-generation/), all actively implementing RAG technology to unlock this new era of data-driven collaboration.


## **4. Unleashing the Power of the RAG System**

In this enlightening journey, we won’t plunge into the intricate depths of the RAG system; instead, we’ll gracefully skim the surface, laying the foundation for a fundamental comprehension of its workings.

Our adventure begins with the crucial first step: **loading data** from a diverse array of sources. Whether it’s PDFs, CSV files, or plain text documents, this domain-specific data is meticulously gathered and consolidated in a central repository, ready for downstream processes.

Next, we navigate the challenge of text size limitations inherent to Large Language Models (LLMs). By ingeniously **splitting the loaded text into manageable chunks**, we ensure that no piece of information is too large to handle.

As we venture further, we encounter the fascinating process of **text embedding**. Here, our chunks of text undergo a transformation into a numeric form, typically vectors. A variety of embedding models stand ready to assist us in this endeavour. These embeddings serve as our compass, guiding us to the most relevant chunks of text for a given query by identifying the most similar chunks in the vast embedding space.

Our journey culminates with the embeddings finding their home in a **vector store**. This final step equips us with the ability to swiftly and efficiently retrieve similar chunks in the embedding space, a testament to the power and precision of the RAG system.

And there you have it folks! - a glimpse into the dynamic world of the *RAG system*, a tool that continues to revolutionise the way we interact with information. *Happy exploring!*

## **5. The Art of Querying**

Now, we dive into the heart of the matter - querying the data. When our bot is presented with a prompt, it springs into action, embarking on a mission to find the most relevant documents. Harnessing the power of the embeddings and vector store, meticulously crafted during the ingestion process, our bot is able to sift through the sea of information and pinpoint the documents that hold the key to our query.

But the journey doesn’t end there. With the standalone question and the relevant documents in hand, our bot takes on the role of a skilled wordsmith. Using a sophisticated language model, such as GPT-3 from OpenAI, it crafts a response that not only addresses the query but does so with the finesse and coherence we’ve come to expect from human communication.

## **6. Wrapping up**

*Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)* isn't just a technological feat; it's an orchestrated interplay of data ingestion, text embedding, and language generation that fundamentally transforms how we interact with information. It stands as a testament to the power of Generative AI, offering a glimpse into a future where domain-specific information retrieval becomes seamless and precise.

While RAG doesn't eliminate all limitations of general LLMs, its ability to integrate domain-specific data acts as a potent catalyst. This empowers LLMs to navigate unfamiliar territory with enhanced accuracy, reliability, and efficiency.

Imagine a medical chatbot leveraging a vast medical database to answer patient queries with unparalleled precision, or a financial analyst equipped with real-time market data, gaining the ultimate edge. These are just glimpses into the boundless possibilities that RAG unlocks. As we dive deeper into this domain-driven approach, we stand on the precipice of a new era, where Generative AI truly lives up to its name, generating insightful responses tailored to the very essence of human needs.
